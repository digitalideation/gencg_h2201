# Day 01

Welcome to the classes generative design @ HSLU / Digital Ideation. This is the main page for the class, you will find a list of resources available below as well as some other information to help with this 3 weeks workshop. It is advised to download / clone this repo at the beginning of the class and eventually keep the `master` branch updated. All assignments / exercises should be done by students on the `journal` branch or some other _"blogging platforms"_ if preferred.

## Computing wihtout computer

### Sollewit: [Wall drawing 118][url03] _(30 mns)_

Fifty randomly placed points all connected by straight lines.

### John H. Conway & Michael S. Patterson: [Sprouts][url02] _(30 mns)_ 

The game starts by drawing any number of spots. For example 3 spots. The first player has a turn by joining two of the spots and marking a new spot in the middle of the line. Or the line may start and end on the same spot.

You are not allowed to draw a line which crosses another line. A spot cannot have more than three lines leading to or from it.  The idea is to make it impossible for the other player to draw a line. So the last person to draw a line is the winner.

### Moniker: [The beach](https://conditionaldesign.org/workshops/the-beach/) _(30 mns)_

Roel: "entering the beach on a sunny day you will look for an empty place and position yourself right in the middle". - A fascinating form of self organization.

### Procedural Drawing: _(30 mns)_

Develop your own procedural drawing instructions based on [Sol Lewitt's work](https://massmoca.org/sol-lewitt/) or some prompts from [Conditional Design](https://conditionaldesign.org/archive). Have one or more of you peers produce a drawing from this system.

## Computing with computer

### 1) Getting familiar with the software

Complete the intro and some of the tutorials from [P5.js learn page](https://p5js.org/learn/)

### 2) Draw then code

Make a simple drawing and try to reproduce it with code. 

### 3) One with everything

Draw all possible geometric shapes you can generate with your software.

### 4) Iteration + randomness 

Build a grid, add some randomness to it (different elements in the grid).

### 5) Map

Build a map of an imaginary place.


## Deliverables

* Documentation and thoughts on Computing without computers (photos, short analysis & take away from the games)
* Code and documentation on Computing with computers, start writing about it in your journal, add some gifs.
* Include a scan or photo of your drawings in the post(s).


## Tools

We will use [__p5.js__ ](https://p5js.org/) for the front end. It’s a high level creative programming framework with an [intuitive API](https://p5js.org/reference/). If some of you have used Processing before you should be confortable using p5.js.
