## :neutral_face: Face Generator

### Brief

Create a program that is generating a parametric face. Your face should at least be controlled by 3 parameters but preferably more. Variations in some of the features can be used to control the expressiveness of the face or some other characteristics (species, gender, etc…) Differentiate continuous parameters (size and position of features) and discrete parameters (piercing, number of eyeballs). Consider the space you’re generating your face in (2D / 3D) and the view angle, front, profile, 3/4?  [^note-id1]

__You must first sketch your idea on paper before working with the software.__ 

### Variations / Steps [^note-id1]

- [ ] Bring your face to life
- [ ] Try using real world data as input
- [ ] Generate a collection (prints, cards) from your face collection

## Deliverables

* Code and documentation of your process, add some live example + gifs / images.
* Include a scan or photo of your drawings in the post

Computer generated images have a certain aesthetics to them that make them immediately recognizable as such by the trained eye. Weird Faces is an attempt to combine my old interest in illustration with programing, to create something procedural that has a truly individual artistic touch to it and is not instantly recognizable as a generative art piece. Even though, the faces look hand-drawn, they are entirely expressed by algorithmic rules. Each face is random, each face is unique. Still, they look similar to my actual hand drawn faces.

In Stranger Visions Heather collected hairs, chewed up gum, and cigarette butts from the streets, public bathrooms and waiting rooms of New York City. She extracted DNA from them and analyzed it to computationally generate 3d printed life size full color portraits representing what those individuals might look like, based on genomic research.

Pareidolia is the tendency for perception to impose a meaningful interpretation on a nebulous stimulus, usually visual, so that one sees an object, pattern, or meaning where there is none.

[_Face Trade - Matthias Dörfelt_](https://www.creativeapplications.net/c/face-trade-art-vending-machine-that-trades-mugshots-for-free-portraits/)  

Face Trade is an Art Vending Machine created by Matthias Dörfelt that dispenses unique prints of computer generated face drawings. Instead of paying with money, buyers trade a mugshot that is taken on the spot in order to be permanently stored in the Ethereum Blockchain, consequently turning the transaction into a semi-permanent Face Swap.

!['Type Face'](images/typeface01.png)  
[_Type Face -Mary Huang_](http://www.creativeapplications.net/processing/typeface-processing/)  

Created by Mary Huang, TYPEFACE is a study of facial recognition and type design, creating a typeface that corresponds to each individual, like a typographic portrait. Somewhat similar to LAIKA project – interactive typeface, the challenge here were the limitations of geometric type system, being able to allow for a great amount of variation while maintaining a general level of quality in the letters.
