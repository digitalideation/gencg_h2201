## :thinking: Reflect / Collect / Prepare

Think back to what we have done so far:
* Collect and document your process (if you haven't done that)
* "Dig further":
    * Which theme did you enjoy the most this week?
    * Is there similar artworks / artists that inspired you?
    * Can you develop your concept? What would you like to create next?
* Experiment more
